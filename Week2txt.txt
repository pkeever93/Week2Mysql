1. I want to know how many employees with each title were born after 1965-01-01.


select count(*), t.title from employees e inner join titles t on e.emp_no = t.emp_no where birth_date > '1965-01-01' order by 'id' desc limit 20;


2. I want to know the average salary per title.

select t.title, avg(s.salary) from employees e inner join salaries s on e.emp_no = s.emp_no inner join titles t on e.emp_no = t.emp_no where birth_date > '1965-01-01' group by t.title order by 'id' desc limit 20;


3. How much money was spent on salary for the marketing department between the years 1990 and 1992?
